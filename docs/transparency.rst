Transparency in PyGfx
=====================

When rendering objects with PyGfx, the shader calculates the color and alpha
value for each fragment (i.e. output pixel) and then writes these to the output
texture (the render target).

In the simplest case, the object is solid (i.e. opaque), and the colors simply overwrite the
colors in the output texture. In other cases, the colors are combined with
those of earlier-rendered objects, and there are multiple ways to do this.


Alpha
-----

Transparency is expressed using an ``alpha`` value. This can be the fourth
component in an RGBA color, e.g. in a color property, colormap or image texture. But it
can also be an explicit value, e.g. ``material.opacity``.

Although alpha values are commonly used to represent transparency, this is not always
the case; they can e.g. be used as the reference value in alpha testing.

In any case, the alpha value represents a weight for how the object is combined with
other objects, and its application is fully defined by ``material.alpha_config``.
Although this config can be customized, the majority of cases can be
captured with a handful of presets that we call *alpha modes*.


Controlling transparency
------------------------

Transparency is a notoriously tricky topic in 3D rendering. Methods that produce
good results out of the box do exist, but are slow and/or consume considerably more memory.
In PyGfx we provide a few different methods that are relatively lean.

There are 3 levels of control:

1. Use the default ``material.alpha_mode = "auto"``:

In this mode, solid objects write depth and blend. Objects that
are opaque (alpha=1) are rendered correctly, as are objects that are
(partially) transparent, as long as the objects
don't intersect (in other words, they can be sorted based on their distance from the
camera). Objects with ``material.opacity<1`` behave the same as with
``alpha_mode`` "blend".

2. Set ``material.alpha_mode`` to a preset string:

These provide configurations for common cases. Examples are "solid",
"blend", "dither", and several more. See below for a full list of options and descriptions.

3. Set the ``alpha_config`` dictionary to have full control:

In this advanced approach you can choose between four methods ("opaque",
"blended", "stochastic", "weighted"), which each have a set of options.
You probably also want to set ``material.depth_write``, and maybe
``material.render_queue`` and/or ``ob.render_order``.


A quick guide to select alpha mode
----------------------------------

If your scene is 2D, you can probably use ``alpha_mode`` "blend". It is advisable
to use the z-dimension to "layer" your objects, which will help the renderer
to draw the objects in the correct order (from back to front). The "auto" mode will
also work (but writes to the depth buffer if ``opacity==1``). And you can always use mode "solid"
for objects that are known to be opaque (and don't have ``material.aa`` set), to help performance.

If your scene is 3D, and you only have a few transparent objects, it's probably best/easiest
to render solid objects with mode "solid", and the few transparent objects with mode "blend".

If you have multiple transparent objects that intersect each-other, the above will not produce
satisfactory results. Maybe you can split the objects into multiple smaller objects, so that they
no longer intersect and can be unambiguously sorted by the renderer, based on their distance to the camera.

Another option to deal with complex transparent geometry is to use mode
"dither". This produces excellent results from a technical perspective (correct
"blending") but produces somewhat noisy images. You can also apply mode "dither"
to *some* of the transparent objects, e.g. the ones with the more complex geometry, and use
"blend" for the rest.

And finally, you can use mode "weighted_blend" to produce a result where the
pixel values of all transparent objects are combined in a way that's independent
of their order or depth. This produces "clear" images, although not really correct, and
intersections of transparent objects are not visible.

A special note for objects that have both opaque and semi-transparent regions:
the "auto" mode may render these correctly, assuming objects can be sorted without intersections.
Otherwise mode "dither" can handle this case perfectly. Though note that using
'dither' to handle the semi-transparent anti-aliased pixels at the edge of an
object is a bad idea.


Alpha modes
-----------

In Pygfx, ``material.alpha_mode`` can be used to define how the alpha value of an object's fragment
is used to combine it with the output texture. There are a range of values to choose from, divided over four different methods:

Method "opaque" (overwrites the value in the output texture):

* "solid": alpha is ignored.
* "solid_premul": the alpha is multiplied with the color (making it darker).

Method "blended" (per-fragment blending of the object's color and the color in the output texture):

* "auto": classic alpha blending, with ``depth_write`` defaulting to True if ``.opacity==1``.
* "blend": classic alpha blending using the over-operator.
* "add": additive blending that adds the fragment color, multiplied by alpha.
* "subtract": subtractive blending that removes the fragment color.
* "multiply": multiplicative blending that multiplies the fragment color.

Method "stochastic" (alpha represents the chance of a fragment being visible):

* "dither": stochastic transparency with blue noise.
* "bayer": stochastic transparency with a Bayer pattern.

Method "weighted" (order independent blending):

* "weighted_blend": weighted blended order independent transparency.
* "weighted_solid": fragments are combined based on alpha, but the final alpha is always 1. Great for e.g. image stitching.


Alpha methods
-------------

Most users don't have to worry much about what the alpha-methods mean. Though it's good to understand
that the "opaque" and "stochastic" methods produce opaque fragments, and by default have ``depth_write=True``.
The renderer sorts these objects front-to-back to avoid overdraw (for performance).

In contrast, the "blended" and "weighted" methods result in semi-transparent fragments,
and by default have ``depth_write=False``. The renderer sorts these object back-to-front to
improve the chance of correct blending. Note that with the 'auto' mode, the default ``depth_write`` depends
on the ``opacity``.


Alpha methods in detail
-----------------------

**Alpha method 'opaque'** represents no transparency. The fragment color
overwrites the value in the output texture. A very common method in render engines.

**Alpha method 'blended'** represents alpha compositing: a common method in
render engines in which objects are combined on a per-fragment basis. The
object's fragment color and the current color in the output texture are blended
using a configurable operator. There are several common blending configurations,
the most-used being the "over operator" (also known as normal blending). When
blending is used, the result will depend on the order in which the objects are
rendered.

**Alpha method 'stochastic'** represents stochastic transparency. The alpha
represents the chance of a fragment being visible (i.e. not discarded). Visible
fragments are opaque. This blend method is less common, but has interesting properties.
Although the result has a somewhat noisy appearance, it handles transparency perfectly,
capable of rendering multiple layers of transparent objects, and correctly handling
objects that have a mix of opaque and transparent fragments.

**Alpha method 'weighted'** represents (variants of) weighted blended order
independent transparency. The order of objects does not matter for the
end-result. One use-case being order independent transparency (OIT).
The order-independent property is advantageous in some use-cases, but produces
unfavourable results in others. It's use extends beyond transparency though, and
can also be used for e.g. image stiching.


Alpha config
------------

The ``material.alpha_config`` is a dictionary that fully describes how the combining based on alpha occurs.
This dictionary has at least two keys: the 'method' and 'mode'. It has additional keys for the options
available for the used method. The different presets represent common combinations of these options.

Most users just set ``material.alpha_mode`` which implicitly sets
``material.alpha_config``. In advanced/special cases, users can set the
``material.alpha_config`` directly to take full control over all available
options. In this case the 'mode' field and ``material.alpha_mode`` become "custom".


Render queue
------------

The ``material.render_queue`` is an integer that represents the group that the renderer uses to sort objects.
The property is intended for advanced use; it is determined automatically
based on ``alpha_method``, ``depth_write`` and ``alpha_test``. Its value can be any integer between 1 and 4999,
and it comes with the following 'builtin' values:

* 1000: background.
* 2000: opaque non-blending objects.
* 2400: opaque objects with a discard based on alpha (i.e. using ``alpha_test`` or "stochasric" alpha-mode).
* 2600: transparent objects that write depth.
* 3000: transparent objects that don't write depth.
* 4000: overlay.

These values are not accessible as enums because that would inhibit assignment of custom values. The set value
also affects behaviour: objects with ``render_queue`` between 1501 and 2500 are sorted front-to-back. Otherwise objects are sorted back-to-front.


Render order
------------

The ``object.render_order`` is a float that allows users to more precisely
control the order in which objects are rendered with respect to other objects in
the same ``render_queue``. You typically don't need this, but when you do, it's
good that you can. The value applies to the object and its children.


How the renderer sorts objects
------------------------------

The renderer sorts objects based on the following factors:

* The ``material.render_queue``.
* The ``object.render_order``.
* The object's distance to the camera, either front-to-back or back-to-front, depending on the ``render_queue``. Objects with alpha-method 'weighted' are not sorted.

Even with this sorting, objects can still intersect other objects (and themselves).
To prevent drawing the (parts of) objects that are occluded by other objects, a depth buffer is used.


Depth buffer
------------

The depth buffer is a texture of the same size as the color output texture, that
stores the distance from the camera of the last drawn fragment. If an object
has ``material.depth_test = True``, fragments that would be further from the
camera (i.e. are occluded by another object) will not be drawn. The ``material.depth_test`` is True by default.

One can also control whether an object writes to the depth buffer. If
``material.depth_write`` is False, objects behind it will still be drawn and visible (although the blending would be incorrect).

Objects that don't write depth are usually drawn after objects that do write depth.
In Pygfx, the default value of ``material.depth_write``
is True when ``material.alpha_method`` is "opaque" or "stochastic", and False otherwise.
