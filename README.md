Pygfx' purpose is to bring powerful and reliable visualization to the Python world. ðŸš€

Pygfx (pronounced "py-graphics") is built on [wgpu](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py/), enabling superior performance and reliability compared to OpenGL-based solutions. It is designed for simplicity and versatility: with its modular architecture, you can effortlessly assemble graphical scenes for diverse applications, from scientific visualization to video game rendering.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U pygfx glfw
```

To work correctly, pygfx needs _some_ window to render to. Glfw is one
lightweight option, but there are others, too. If you use a different
wgpu-compatible window manager or only render offscreen you may choose to omit
glfw. Examples of alternatives include: `jupyter_rfb` (rendering in Jupyter),
`PyQt`, `PySide`, or `wx`.

In addition there are some platform
requirements, see the [wgpu docs](https://wgpu-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start.html). In
essence, you need modern (enough) graphics drivers, and `pip>=20.3`.

## Status

We're currently working towards version `1.0`, which means that the API
can change with each version. We expect to reach `1.0` near the end of
2024, at which point we start caring about backwards compatibility.

This means that until then, you should probably pin the pygfx version
that you're using, and check the [release notes](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx/releases)
when you update.

## Usage Example

> **Note**
> The example below is designed against the `main` branch,
> and may not work on the latest release from pypi, while we're in beta.

> **Note**
> A walkthrough of this example can be found in [the
> guide](https://pygfx.com/stable/guide.html#how-to-use-pygfx).

```python
import pygfx as gfx
import pylinalg as la

cube = gfx.Mesh(
    gfx.box_geometry(200, 200, 200),
    gfx.MeshPhongMaterial(color="#336699"),
)

rot = la.quat_from_euler((0, 0.01), order="XY")

def animate():
    cube.local.rotation = la.quat_mul(rot, cube.local.rotation)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    gfx.show(cube, before_render=animate)

```

## Feature Highlights
Some of pygfx's key features are:

- SDF based text rendering ([example](
  https://pygfx.com/stable/_gallery/feature_demo/text_contrast.html))
- order-independent transparency (OIT) ([example](
  https://pygfx.com/stable/_gallery/feature_demo/transparency2.html))
- lights, shadows, and physically based rendering (PBR) ([example](
  https://pygfx.com/stable/_gallery/feature_demo/pbr.html))
- event system with built-in picking ([example](
  https://pygfx.com/stable/_gallery/feature_demo/picking_points.html))
- texture and color mapping supporting 1D, 2D and 3D data ([example](
  https://pygfx.com/stable/_gallery/feature_demo/colormap_channels.html))


And many more! Check out our [feature demos](

### Development Install
To get a working dev install of pygfx you can use the following steps:

```bash
# Click the Fork button on GitHub and navigate to your fork
git clone <address_of_your_fork>
cd pygfx
# if you use a venv, create and activate it
pip install -e ".[dev,docs,examples]"
