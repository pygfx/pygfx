Video YUV
=========

This example demonstrates how to show video data in a very efficient way,
eliminating as much data-copies and color conversion operations as we can.

Reading
-------

Many videos are encoded using yuv420p. Therefore, loading the video in
that format, instead of requesting rgb frames, saves computation and
data copies upon reading.

Uploading
---------

The YUV data can also be uploaded directly to the texture, albeit in
three chunks. RGBA frames can be send in one chunk (although it is
considerably larger). For RGB data, the data must first be converted
to RGBA, which is costly. (This packing is normally done automatically
by the pygfx Texture).

Size
----

Frames in yuv420p format are half the size of RGB frames (and even less
compared to RGBA) so the upload itself is cheaper, and memory
consumption on the CPU and GPU are reduced.

Implementation details
----------------------

We demonstrate 2 different storage formats for planar YUV textures:

1. In the first, we use a 2-layer grayscale texture. The u and v planes
   fit in a single layer since they're half the size (in both dimensions).
2. In the second, we use 3 different grayscale textures. The u and v textures
   are half the size in each dimension making for more efficent storage.

While the differences are subtle, the first option reduces the overall
total number of Textures that are maintained in the scene, while the second
can save some storage space on the GPU.

Benchmarks
----------

This script can be done to benchmark for different formats. We've performed
benchmarks against videos encoded with yuv420p and we've found that
that using yuv420p data is certainly the fastest. Using rgba is a bit
slower, although it consumes more memory, so its disadvantage may
increase for heavy workloads. Reading the data as RGB has terrible
performance. We believe that this is caused by the fact that RGB images must
be converted to RGBA pior to uploading them to the GPU.
This is unfortunate, because it's the format that many
default to.
See https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx/pull/873 for details.
