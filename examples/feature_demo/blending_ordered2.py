Blending ordered2
=================

The 'ordered2' was a previously supported blend mode (when blending as
defined on the renderer). This example mimics it's behaviour.

This example draws a red (top) and a green (bottom) circle. The circles
are opaque but have a transparent edge. I.e. the objects have both
opaque and transparent fragments, which is a case that easily results in
wrong blending.

We deliberately cause wrong blending: the green circle is drawn after
the red one, but it is also behind the red one. This means that without
proper care, the edge of the red circle hides the green circle.

By first rendering only the opaque fragments, and then rendering the transparent
fragments, this can be fixed. To do this, we use the alpha test.
