Compute data and send over zmq to be rendered by Pygfx in another process
=========================================================================

Example that demonstrates how to use zmq send data to another process that then uses Pygfx to visualize it.
Use in conjunction with "view.py" in this directory.

First run `view.py`, and then separately run `compute.py`
