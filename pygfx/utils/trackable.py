"""
Implements the base classes for trackable classes.

## Introduction

This module implemented in a more or less generic way. The code does not
refer to world objects, geometry, materials or resources. But don't be
fooled - this code is *very* much tailored to the needs of such objects.
In particular:

* we want to track properties (that may need to trigger a pipeline).
* we want to be able to track objects themselves depending on the situation
  (because the pipeline only cares about the object's properties while the
  bindings much match to the correct buffers/textures).
* we want to be able to swap out similar objects and not trigger of the
  new object has the same properties as before (so that we can e.g. replace
  colormaps or texture atlasses).
* we also want to track "external objects" that are not in the tree of the root.

The last two points mean that the code must be aware of the tree
structure, but must also be able to track external Trackable objects
(wich may also have a tree).

## High level overview

We define a Trackable object as something of which the properties can
be tracked (its properties can be other Trackable objects).

The RootTrackable is the object that keeps track of the changes. One
first tracks usage of properties, after which any changes to these
properties get communicated to this root. Any trackable can participate
(not only the trackables in the tree of the root).

## Finer details

The Trackable uses a Store - a custom dictionary object that has hooks
for attribute access. This is where the magic happens. The Trackable
object itself is just a container for the store. This has the benefit
that subclasses of Trackable just store the props that they want to
track on its store.

Similarly the functionality of the RootTrackable is offloaded to an
internal Root object. That way the RootTrackable (and its subclasses)
stay clean, and can implement their own API for the tracking.

The Store keeps a set of what roots need to be notified (using weak
refs). The root keeps a set of what stores notify it, for the sole
reason that the root can disconnect these stores when usage is
re-tracked.

Every store has a unique id, and the root uses (id, prop) tuples as
keys to keep track of things. When a property sets/unsets a Trackable,
the tree is resolved at that moment (i.e. the root is temporary aware
of the tree). This avoids the need for the root (or stores?) to keep
track of a hierarchy which would make the code a lot more complex (I
tried and it was not fun). The only downside (that I can think of) is
that setting `matererial.map = other_map` works while
`matererial.map = None; material.map = other_map` does not, because
there is no persistent knowledge of hierarchy.
