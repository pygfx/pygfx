    Select an adapter as obtained via ``wgpu.gpu.enumerate_adapters()``, which

        adapters_discrete = [a for a in adapters if "DiscreteGPU" in a.summary]

    Note that using this function reduces the portability of your code, because
    it's highly specific for your current machine/environment.

    The order of the adapters returned by ``wgpu.gpu.enumerate_adapters()`` is
    such that Vulkan adapters go first, then Metal, then D3D12, then OpenGL.
    Within each category, the order as provided by the particular backend is
    maintained. Note that the same device may be present via multiple backends
    (e.g. vulkan/opengl).

    We cannot make guarantees about whether the order of the adapters matches
    the order as reported by e.g. ``nvidia-smi``. We have found that on a Linux
    multi-gpu cluster, the order does match, but we cannot promise that this is
    always the case. If you want to make sure, do some testing by allocating big
    buffers and checking memory usage using ``nvidia-smi``.

    Example to allocate and check GPU mem usage::

        import subprocess

        import wgpu
        import torch

        def allocate_gpu_mem_with_wgpu(idx):
            a = wgpu.gpu.enumerate_adapters()[idx]

        def allocate_gpu_mem_with_torch(idx):
            d = torch.device(f"cuda:{idx}")
            return torch.ones([2000, 10], dtype=torch.float32, device=d)

        def show_mem_usage():
            print(subprocess.run(["nvidia-smi"]))
