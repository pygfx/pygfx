"""Objects to draw a scene onto a canvas.

The purpose of a renderer is to render (i.e. draw) a scene to a canvas or
texture. It also provides picking, defines the anti-aliasing parameters, and any
post processing effects.

A renderer is directly associated with its target and can only render to that
target. Different renderers can render to the same target though.

It provides a ``.render()`` method that can be called one or more times to
render scenes. This creates a visual representation that is stored internally,
and is finally rendered into its render target (the canvas or texture)::

                              __________
                             | blender  |
    [scenes] -- render() --> |  state   | -- flush() --> [target]
                             |__________|

The internal representation is managed by the blender object. The internal
render textures are typically at a higher resolution to reduce aliasing (SSAA).
The blender has auxilary buffers such as a depth buffer, pick buffer, and
buffers for transparent fragments. Depending on the blend mode, a single render
call may consist of multiple passes (to deal with semi-transparent fragments).

The flush-step resolves the internal representation into the target texture or
canvas, averaging neighbouring fragments for anti-aliasing.
