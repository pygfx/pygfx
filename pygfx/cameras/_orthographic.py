class OrthographicCamera(PerspectiveCamera):
    """An orthographic camera, useful for orthograpic views and 2D content.

    Technically, this is a PerspectiveCamera with the fov locked to zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width: float
        The (minimum) width of the view-cube. The actual view
        may be wider if the viewport is relatively wide.
    height: float
        The (minimum) height of the view-cube. The actual view
        may be heigher if the viewport is relatively heigh.
    zoom: float
        An additional zoom factor, equivalent to attaching a zoom lens.
    maintain_aspect: bool
        Whether the aspect ration is maintained as the window size changes.
        Default True. If false, the dimensions are stretched to fit the window.
    depth_range: 2-tuple
        The values for the near and far clipping planes. If not given
        or None, the clip planes will be calculated automatically based
        on the fov, width, and height.
