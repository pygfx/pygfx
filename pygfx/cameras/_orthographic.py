from ._perspective import PerspectiveCamera


class OrthographicCamera(PerspectiveCamera):
    """An orthographic camera, useful for orthograpic views and 2D content.

    Technically, this is a PerspectiveCamera with the fov locked to zero.
    You can use this instead of a PerspectiveCamera if you have data that does
    not make sense to view with a nonzero fov.

    When used with the show methods and/or a controller, the ``OrthographicCamera``'s
    position does not move along the view-axis (to zoom in/out), unlike the
    ``PerspectiveCamera``, which does this even when fov is 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width: float
        The (minimum) width of the view-cube. The actual view
        may be wider if the viewport is relatively wide. Default 1.
    height: float
        The (minimum) height of the view-cube. The actual view
        may be taller if the viewport is relatively high. Default 1.
    zoom: float
        An additional zoom factor, equivalent to attaching a zoom lens.
    maintain_aspect: bool
        Whether the aspect ration is maintained as the window size changes.
        Default True. If false, the dimensions are stretched to fit the window.
     depth: float | None
        The reference size of the scene in the depth dimension. By default this value gets set
        to the average of ``width`` and ``height``. This happens on initialization and by ``show_pos()``, ``show_object()`` and ``show_rect()``.
        It is used to calculate a sensible depth range when ``depth_range`` is not set.
    depth_range: 2-tuple | None
        The explicit values for the near and far clip planes. If not given
        or None (the default), the clip planes ware calculated using ``fov`` and ``depth``.
