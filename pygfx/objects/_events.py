class Event:

    If a target is set, an event can bubble up through a hierarchy
    of targets, connected through a ``parent`` property.
    To prevent an event from bubbling up, use ``stop_propagation``.

    It is also possible to cancel events, which will stop any further
    handling of the event (also by the same target).

    Parameters
    ----------
    type : Union[str, EventType]
        The name of the event.
    bubbles : bool
        If True, the event bubbles up through the scene tree.
    target : EventTarget
        The object onto which the event was dispatched.
    root : RootEventHandler
        A reference to the root event handler.
    time_stamp : float
        The time at which the event was created (in ms). Might not be an actual
        time stamp so please only use this for relative time measurements.
    cancelled : bool
        A boolean value indicating whether the event is cancelled.
