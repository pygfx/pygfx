        The color of the light emitted.
    intensity : float
        The light's intensity. Its units depend on the type of light. For point

    cast_shadow : bool

    -----
    The light's intensity scales the color in the physical colorspace, as if
    scaling the number of photons. Note that an intensity of 0.5 is not
    equivalent to halving the color value. This is because the srgb color is
    perceptually linear, while intensity is physically linear. Values over 1.0

    a Light, and `receive_shadow` on the illuminated object. Shadows will only
    be displayed if both are set to True.
