    Parameters
    ----------
    opacity : float
        The opacity (a.k.a. alpha value) applied to this material, expressed as
        a value between 0 and 1. If the material contains any non-opaque
        fragments, their alphas are simply scaled by this value.
    clipping_planes : tuple
        A tuple of planes (abcd tuples) in world space. Points in space whose
        signed distance to the plane is negative are clipped (not rendered).
        Applies to the object to which this material is attached.
    clipping_mode : str
        Set the behavior for multiple clipping planes: "any" or "all". If this
        is "any" (the default) a fragment is discarded if it is clipped by any
        clipping plane. If this is "all", a fragment is discarded only if it is
        clipped by *all* of the clipping planes.
    depth_test : bool
        Whether the object takes the depth buffer into account.
        Default True. If False, the object is like a ghost: not testing
        against the depth buffer and also not writing to it.
